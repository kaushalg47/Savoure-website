      <h3>Steps to preperation:</h3><br>
      <p>Step 1 Prepare the dry flour mixture
        To make this delicious recipe, take a mixing bowl and combine wheat flour, salt and baking powder. Whisk the mixture until entirely incorporated.
        <br>
        Step 2 Make a batter by combining wet mixture with dry flour mixture
        Take another fresh bowl and pour in milk, vanilla extract, sugar and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Blend the liquid mixture nicely. Now, slowly pour the liquid mixture into the dry flour mixture (Step 1). Stir and fold the mixture thoroughly until you get a batter with no lumps for the pancakes. Let the batter rest for 5 to 6 minutes till it gets fluffy.
        <br>
        Step 3 Cook the pancakes on a hot griddle and serve hot and fresh
        Preheat a large non-stick griddle on a medium-low heat and pour a tablespoon of virgin olive oil into it. Now, scoop the batter onto the hot griddle and let it cook for 2 minutes. Flip the side of the pancake and cook the other side for 2 minutes as well. Cook both the sides until they turn a beautiful golden brown in colour. Repeat the step for the remaining batter and garnish resplendently with blueberries and banana slices. Serve immediately.</p>
