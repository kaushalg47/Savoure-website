      <h3>Steps to preperation:</h3><br>
      <p>Step 1 Blanch the corn
        Firstly, let the frozen corn thaw on room temperature. Boil 2 cups of water in a pot. Once water comes to a boil, add corn and cook on high flame for 2 minutes. Take out the corn and submerge them in cold water.
        <br>
        Step 2 Pan fry the sausages
        Heat butter in a non-stick pan. Add the sausages and pan fry them until cooked. Also toast the hot dog breads if you wish.
        <br>
        Step 3 Make the filling
        In a bowl, add sweet corn along with finely chopped onion and tomato. Add salt as per taste, lemon juice, red chilli powder and mayonnaise. Give a good mix.
        <br>
        Step 4 Make Hotdogs
        Take a hotdog bread and make a cut in the middle. Stuff the sausage in it along with the corn filling. Repeat this step with the other two hotdog breads.
        <br>
        Step 5 Ready to be served
        Your Corn Hotdog is now ready to be served. Enjoy!
