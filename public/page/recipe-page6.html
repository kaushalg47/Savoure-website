      <h3>Steps to preperation:</h3><br>
      <p>Step 1 Knead the dough and soak moong dal for 2 hours
        Take a large bowl and mix together whole wheat flour, semolina, gram flour and ghee. Using a little water, knead the mixture to a thick, pliable dough. Once done, cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it aside for preparing the kachori. Afterwards, soak moong dal in a bowl for 2 hours in a large bowl. Once done, drain the extra water and keep it aside.
        <br>
        Step 2 Stir fry the dal and when cooled, grind into coarse mixture
        Next, put a frying pan over medium flame and heat a little ghee in it. Once the ghee is melted, add the soaked moong dal in it and stir fry for a minute. Once fried a bit, turn off the flame and transfer the fried dal to a grinder jar. When the dal is cool enough to handle, grind to form a coarse mixture. Then, add all the filling ingredients into the grinding jar and grind them roughly.
        <br>
        Step 3 Make a small paratha and deep fry, then make a medium hole in between
        Now, take out a small portion of the prepared dough and using a rolling pin, roll it into a small puri. Just like stuffed paratha, fill it with a tablespoon of the filling and fold well. Then, using a little dry flour, roll the puri again. Meanwhile, put a kadhai on high flame and heat refined oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add this puri in it and deep fry until the puri is crisp and golden. Once fried, put it on a napkin to soak the extra oil. Once done, make a hole in the centre.
        <br>
        Step 4 Add all the filling ingredients and garnish with sev
        Now, take a mixing bowl and add boiled potatoes in it along with chana and boiled moong sprouts. Mix them with yoghurt, green chutney, sweet tamarind chutney, chaat masala powder, chopped coriander leaves, onion, salt and green chillies. Then, fill the kachori with this mixture and garnish with hung curd, green chutney, sweet tamarind chutney, chaat masala powder, salt, coriander leaves, crushed papdis and cumin powder. Make the final garnishing of sev.
