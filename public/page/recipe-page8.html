      <h1>The Recipe</h1><br>
      <p>Craving something lip-smacking but don't want to spend hours in the kitchen making a dish? Then we have the perfect dish for you. Prepared in less than 15 minutes, this yummy paneer dish can be either served as a main dish or enjoyed as a snack. Paneer is quite rich in protein, which makes this dish weight-loss friendly. We have used just 1 spoon olive oil to make it, which makes the recipe quite healthy. The best thing about this dish is that veggies don't need to be cooked for long. You just need to toss and cook the veggies to keep them crunchy. You can add green beans, carrot, cabbage and even corn to make the dish more nutritious. This Paneer Chilly recipe is prepared without adding any sauces like soy sauce, ketchup or schezwan sauce but is still equally good in taste. </p>
